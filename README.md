LASSI - **LA**ttice **S**imulation Engine For **S**t**i**ckers And Spacers
==========================================================================

LASSI is a versatile simulation engine designed to perform Monte-Carlo 
(MC) simulations for phase transitions of explicit polymer 
instantiations of the *Stickers-and-Spacers* formalism. 
Furthermore, LASSI is designed, from the ground up, around 
anisotropic interactions between individual monomers.

For information about the underlying physics and an applied example, please see this 
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007028).

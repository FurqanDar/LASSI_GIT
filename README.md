LASSI - **LA**ttice **S**imulation Engine For **S**t**i**ckers And Spacers
==========================================================================

LASSI is an engine designed for simulating the phase transitions
of polymers with specific anisotropic interactions.

For information about the underlying physics and an applied example, please see this 
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007028).

LASSI was written by Furqan Dar and Jeong-Mo Choi in the [Pappu Lab](http://pappulab.wustl.edu/).

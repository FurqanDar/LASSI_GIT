# External files
STRUCT_FILETYPE 0  #0: Random Initial Conditions; 1: From restart file below.
STRUCT_FILE     structure_SM.prm # name of structure file
RESTART_FILE    ##DUMMY## #Can be a dummy name if not using. MUST be after STRUCT_FILE
## For the restart keyword, given the correct structure file, the checkpoint frames written at the beginning of every
## annealing cycle can be used. SMol_{#}_trj.lammpstrj, where {#} is the annealing cycle number.

Single Molecule Example - DiBlock Copolymer
-------------------------------------------

This example illustrates the basics of making key files, energy files and structure files.
Go through `structure_SM.prm` `energy_SM.prm` and `param_SM.key` in that order.
Then, assuming that the code is compiled, run using `./../../src/lassi -k param_SM.key`

After the simulation/run has finished, you can use VMD to visualize the trajectory using `Visualize_SM.vmd`

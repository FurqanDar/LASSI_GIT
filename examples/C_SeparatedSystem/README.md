Many Molecules Example - 2 Homopolymers
---------------------------------------

This example builds upon Example B where the diblock copolymer is broken into a set of two homopolymers,
where the total number of stickers is conserved. Read `structure_S.prm` and `param_S.key` to see the differences from Example A.
Assuming that the code is compiled, run using `./../../src/lassi -k param_S.key`

After the simulation/run has finished, you can use VMD to visualize the trajectory using `Visualize_S.vmd`

Many Molecules Example - DiBlock Copolymers
-------------------------------------------

This example builds upon Example A, and simulates an ensemble of 500 molecules, rather than a single molecule.
Read `structure_DB.prm` and `param_DB.key` to see the differences from Example A.
Assuming that the code is compiled, run using `./../../src/lassi -k param_DB.key`

After the simulation/run has finished, you can use VMD to visualize the trajectory using `Visualize_DB.vmd`

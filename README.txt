Introduction
------------

LASSI is a versatile simulation engine designed to perform Monte-Carlo  (MC) simulations for phase transitions of explicit polymer instantiations of the *Stickers-and-Spacers* formalism. Furthermore, LASSI is designed, from the ground up, around  anisotropic interactions between individual monomers. LASSI can be used to generate full phase diagrams for a given polymer architecture (although rings aren't yet implemented).
